# Hits Counter

Due to the recent close down of [hits.seeyoufarm.com](https://github.com/gjbae1212/hit-counter), I decided to recreate the same service. <br>Thanks <a href="https://github.com/gjbae1212">@gjbae1212</a> for the hardworking.

## What is this?

This project allows you to create a badge like this:

![Badge](https://hitscounter.dev/api/hit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdonaldzou%2Fhits-counter&label=Visitor&icon=github&color=%23198754)

to record how many visit your site have!

## How to use?
Visit [Hits Counter](https://hitscounter.dev) to create your badge

You should see the **Result** section below right away.

Once you're satisfied with the result, simply copy & paste the code below to your website (HTML) or Markdown file. With the URL, you can also get the JSON result of the badge by simply toggling the JSON switch under **URL**.
